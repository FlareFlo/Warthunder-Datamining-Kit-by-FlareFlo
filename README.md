Things to install beforehand;
java JDE 15 or later

Reccomended tools;
FileDiff - To compare Files dispaying all differences between lines

Steps on how to use;

Retrieve binary files from warthunder/cache/binary[gameversion]
drag and drop contents of the dataminer tool into the folder (you should have the .vrfoms and .bat files in the same directory)
execute the first "Start Extraction.bat"
Wait for both programs to run, until no more but one prompt are open titled "file deleter" (Displaying a menu with options)

Your extraction is finished, however, following steps are reccomended to view the files easier;
Select "1" and press enter, then type ".blk". (This is because .blk files are not viewable, since they are a "byproduct" of the extraction, and only use up storage)
Select "2" and press enter, then wait for execution. (This is because there are 0 byte "default" files that serve no purpose)
